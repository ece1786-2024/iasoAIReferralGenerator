Condition: has asthma
Begin Conversation: 

**Doctor:** Good morning, Mr. Thompson. How are you feeling today?

**Patient:** Good morning, Dr. Patel. I've been better, to be honest. My breathing has been more difficult lately, and I've had a few more asthma attacks than usual.

**Doctor:** I'm sorry to hear that. I see from your records that you've been managing asthma for quite some time. Given your recent symptoms, I believe it would be beneficial for you to see a specialist. I'm going to refer you to the Asthma Education Clinic with an Asthma Educator (RRT) at Markham Stouffville Hospital. It's important to get a more detailed assessment and perhaps adjust your treatment plan.

**Patient:** That sounds like a good idea. Is this an urgent referral?

**Doctor:** No, it's a routine referral. But we should get you in as soon as possible to prevent any further complications. Today is October 10th, 2023, so we can aim to get you scheduled in the next couple of weeks.

**Patient:** Alright, I trust your judgment, Dr. Patel.

**Doctor:** Great. Just to confirm some details for the referral: Your Hospital MRN is 12345678, and your full name is Thompson, John. Your date of birth is 15th March 1975, correct?

**Patient:** Yes, that's correct.

**Doctor:** Perfect. You're listed as male, and your Ontario Health Card number is 1234-567-890 with the version code AB. I see you don't have a WSIB number, so we can skip that part.

**Patient:** Yes, I'm not a part of WSIB.

**Doctor:** Noted. You're not self-paying or a refugee, so we'll proceed with your insurance details. Your address is 123 Maple Street, Toronto, ON, M1B 2K4, and your phone number is 416-555-1234. Is there an alternative number you'd like to add?

**Patient:** No, that's my main number. But you can use my email for any additional information: john.thompson@email.com.

**Doctor:** Excellent. Also, I see that your preferred language is English, so there's no need for an interpreter. Just for your information, my CPSO number is 543210, and if you need to reach me, my office phone number is 416-555-6789.

**Patient:** Thank you, Dr. Patel. I appreciate you organizing this referral for me.

**Doctor:** You're welcome, Mr. Thompson. I'll get the referral processed today, and the clinic will reach out to you soon with an appointment. If you have any more concerns or if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to contact me.
